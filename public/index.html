  <h1>5 minute fork</h1>
  <p>As described on hackernews:</p>
  <blockquote><p>If a github repo has an index.html file and you click on it, github will show you the source instead of the webpage.<br><br>5minfork shows you the webpage so that you can have an idea of what the repo is about.</p></blockquote>
  <h2>Why?</h2>
  <p>Heard of 10 minute email? Well this is the same thing, except for github repos.</p>

  <p>The number of times I've come across a cool demo, only to be faced with a github repo and no live link - it just bums me out.</p>
  
  <p>So I made this (quickly - literally about 90 minutes), which reads the url, and forks the project. If the url is idle for 5 minutes, then it's automatically discarded and swept under the carpet. I wrote up more <a href="http://remysharp.com/2013/03/18/quick-dirty-forking/">detail about 5minfork</a> on my blog if you're interested.</p>

  <h2>How to fork for 5 minutes</h2>
  <p>Simply take a public github url and swap out the <code>https://github.com</code> for <code>http://5minfork.com</code>, wait a moment for the project to be cloned, and then you'll be redirected to a unique url which will serve up static content from the project.</p>

  <h2>Fork this?</h2>
  <p>If you're interested in the code, have found a bug, want to fix a bug, have written a browser extension (go on - you know you want to) - the code is <a href="http://rem.mit-license.org/">freely</a> available on github: <a href="https://github.com/remy/5minutefork">https://github.com/remy/5minutefork</a></p>
